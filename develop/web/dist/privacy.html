				<h1>Privacy Policy of Mail helper</h1>

				Last modified: December 26, 2018
		
				<p>
					Mail helper operates on Fireabse web hosting: 
					<a href="https://fir-playgrounds.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank" title="Mail helper">https://fir-playgrounds.firebaseapp.com</a>
					
					This page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, 
					use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
					
					The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, 
					which is accessible at 
					<a href="terms.html" 
						 title="Mail helper - Terms of service"

					unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

				<h3>Why I've been working on this tool ?</h3>

				<p>
					Each day my mailbox receives a lot of emails. 
					To reduce my reading time I've been using a lot of labels (at this moment I have 500+ diffferent labels). 
					I'd like to introduce a term "on the stage": <strong>structure data.</strong>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Structure data</strong> - email message has at least one label.</p>

				<p>
					I created this tool because I'd like to increase my productivity. 
					<strong>First version creates a filter. Filter creates or update an existing label.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					I'll be happy to share this tool with other folks. 
					My tool requires only three requires only three Gmail Access Scopes to operate:

					<ul>
						<li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly - Read all resources and their metadataâ€”no write operations.</li>
						<li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels - Create, read, update, and delete labels only.</li>
						<li>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic - Manage basic mail settings.</li>
					</ul>

					If you want to understand more about gmail scopes and privacy of your information, please visit: 
					<a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes" title="Gmail scopes" target="_blank">Gmail scopes</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					Our service reads label and filter meta and creates filter by keyword. 
					If label doesn't we exist.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our service doesn't <strong>Delete or Update</strong> your label meta data.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Our service doesn't <strong>Delete or update</strong> your filter meta data.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Our service doesn't <strong>access other mail settings</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm using Gmail API to generate a json web token to authorize your profile and access your label and meta data 
				</p>
